# Hacky Video platform

## Purpose

I got a whole bunch of videos, that exist and accumulate. 

When seeking to illustrate various considerations, a simple way of presenting them is sought to be produced.

## Method

I've got a video library called [Magnet-Library](https://github.com/KanekarSnehal/Magnet-Library) and i'm hacking the AUTH, Login and other parts that are not needed out of it.  

The derivative is intended to be deployed on Google Pages or similar. 

The database will be a JSON file that will be created externally and updated manually.

## Status

I've hacked away some parts, and am now working on how to produce the video-database json file. 

More hacking is needed - then there needs to be a deployment script.
